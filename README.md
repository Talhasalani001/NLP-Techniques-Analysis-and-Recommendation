## Project Overview

This project is part of the **CS/CE 457/464 Homework Assignment 10** and aims to apply basic NLP techniques for analyzing and processing text data. It covers the following tasks:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  
   Analyze an article for named entities, visualize the results, and discuss findings and algorithm shortcomings.

2. **Word Frequency and Keyword Extraction:**  
   Apply three techniques/libraries to extract keywords and compute word frequency from a research paper. Visualize and compare results, highlighting any limitations of the methods.

3. **Sentiment Analysis on Tweets:**  
   - Collect at least 20 tweets related to a keyword or Twitter handle.  
   - Perform sentiment analysis, showing counts of positive and negative sentiments.  
   - Analyze and display one positive and one negative tweet, discussing the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.

4. **Recommendation Engines:**  
   Build and compare recommendation engines using:  
   - **TF-IDF Method**  
   - **Word2Vec (Doc2Vec) Model**  
   Evaluate and compare the quality and accuracy of recommendations for both models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Libraries:**
  - `spaCy` (for NER and NLP analysis)
  - `NLTK` (for keyword extraction and sentiment analysis)
  - `Scikit-Learn` (for TF-IDF and modeling)
  - `Gensim` (for Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models)
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` (for visualizations)
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` (for data handling)

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Select an article from a website of your choice.
- Perform NER analysis and visualize the results.
- Interpret findings and discuss any shortcomings of the algorithm.

### Task 2: Word Frequency and Keyword Extraction
- Choose a research paper for analysis.
- Apply at least three keyword extraction techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, RAKE, spaCy).
- Visualize and compare the results of the methods.

### Task 3: Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
- Collect at least 20 tweets for a keyword or Twitter handle.
- Perform sentiment analysis and count positive/negative sentiments.
- Display one positive and one negative sentiment with accuracy evaluation.

### Task 4: Recommendation Engines
- Build recommendation engines using:
  - **TF-IDF Method**
  - **Word2Vec (Doc2Vec) Model**
- Compare the quality and accuracy of both engines.
